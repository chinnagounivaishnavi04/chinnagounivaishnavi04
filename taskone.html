<h1><center>Wonders Of The World</center></h1>
<body>
    The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the oldest known list of this type, 
    documenting the most remarkable man-made creations of classical antiquity;
     it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic sightseers and as such only includes works located around the Mediterranean rim and in the ancient Near East. 
     The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty, 
     and because it reflected the number of planets known in ancient times (five) plus the Sun and Moon.
     The Greek historian Herodotus (484 – c. 425 BC) and the scholar Callimachus of Cyrene (c. 305–240 BC), at the Museum of Alexandria, made early lists of seven wonders. These lists have not survived, however, except as references in other writings.

<h2>Seven Wonders of the Ancient World</h2>
The classic Seven Wonders were:
<ul>
<li>Great Pyramid of Giza, in El Giza, Egypt, the earliest of the wonders to be completed, as well as the only one that still exists in the present day.</li>
<li>Colossus of Rhodes, in the harbor of the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name.</li>
<li>Gardens of Babylon, in Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, Iraq; or Nineveh, Mosul, Nineveh Governorate, Iraq.</li>
<li>Lighthouse of Alexandria, in Alexandria, Egypt.</li>
<li>Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, in Halicarnassus, a city of the Achaemenid Empire in present-day Turkey.</li>
<li>Statue of Zeus at Olympia, in Olympia,Greece</li>
<li>Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, in the city of Ephesus, near present-day Selçuk, Turkey.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lists from other eras</h2>
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, some writers emulated the classical list by creating their own lists with names such as "Wonders of the Middle Ages", "Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages", "Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind", and "Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages".
It is unlikely that any of these lists actually originated in the Middle Ages since the concept of a "Middle Age" did not become popular until at least the 16th century and the word "medieval" was not invented until the Enlightenment era. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable refers to them as "later list[s]",suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages.

Many of the structures on these lists were built much earlier than the Middle Ages but were well known throughout the world.Typically representative of such lists are:
<ul>
<li>Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa, a 2nd-century funerary complex in Alexandria, Egypt.</li>
<li>Colosseum, a 1st-century amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy.</li>
<li>Great Wall of China, a series of defensive fortifications built across the historical northern borders of China, with some segments dating to as early as the 7th century BC.
<li>Hagia Sophia, a 6th-century cathedral and mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.</li>
<li>Leaning Tower of Pisa, a 12th-century bell tower in Pisa, Italy.</li>
<li>Tower of Nanjing, a 15th-century pagoda on the south bank of the external Qinhuai River in Nanjing, People's Republic of China.</li>
<li>Stonehenge, a Neolithic henge monument in Wiltshire, England dated to the 3rd millennium BC.</li>
</ul>
Other structures sometimes included on such lists include:
<ul>
<li>Cairo Citadel, a 13th-century Islamic fortification in Cairo, Egypt.</li>
<li>Cluny Abbey, a 10th-century Benedictine monastery in Cluny, Saône-et-Loire, France.[9]
<li>Ely Cathedral, a (currently Anglican) cathedral originally built in the 11th century in Ely, Cambridgeshire, England.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Seven Natural Wonders of the World</h2>
Similar to the other lists of wonders, there is no consensus on a list of seven natural wonders of the world, and there has been debate over how large such a list should be. One of many existing versions of this list was compiled by CNN in 1997:[16]

<li>Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of Queensland, Australia</li>
<li>Harbor of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</li>
<li>Mount Everest, on the border of Nepal and China</li>
<li>Parícutin volcano, located in the state of Michoacán, Mexico</li>
<li>Victoria Falls, on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe</li>
</ul>
<h2>New 7 Wonders of the World</h2>
In 2001, an initiative was started by the Swiss corporation New7Wonders Foundation to choose the New 7 Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing monuments through online votes.[17] The Great Pyramid of Giza—part of the Giza Pyramids, the only remaining wonder of the traditional Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was not one of the winners announced in 2007 but was added as an honorary candidate.[18][19]

<h2>New 7 Wonders of Nature</h2>
A similar contemporary effort to create a list of seven natural (as opposed to man-made) wonders chosen through a global poll, called the New 7 Wonders of Nature, was organized from 2007 to 2011 by the same group as the New 7 Wonders of the World campaign.

<h2>Seven Wonders of the Underwater World </h2>
The list of "Seven Wonders of the Underwater World" was drawn up by CEDAM International, an American-based non-profit group for divers that is dedicated to ocean preservation and research. In 1989, CEDAM brought together a panel of marine scientists, including Eugenie Clark, to choose underwater areas which they considered worthy of protection. The results were announced at The National Aquarium in Washington, D.C., by actor Lloyd Bridges, star of TV's Sea Hunt:[21]

<h2>Seven Wonders of the Industrial World </h2>
British author Deborah Cadbury wrote Seven Wonders of the Industrial World, a book telling the stories of seven great feats of engineering of the 19th and early 20th centuries.[22] In 2003, the BBC aired a seven-part docudrama exploring the same feats, with Cadbury as a producer. [23]
